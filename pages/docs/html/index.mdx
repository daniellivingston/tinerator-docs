# HTML Library

The StaticKit HTML library is designed for environments where you are authoring plain HTML (as opposed to using a framework like React). If you are using a static site generator like **Jekyll**, **Hugo**, or **Middleman**, this is the library for you.

Using React? Check out our native [React library](/docs/react) instead.

## Installation

If you don't have a modern JavaScript build pipeline in place, the CDN method is the quickest way to get up and running — just place our `<script>` tag anywhere on your page:

```html
<script defer src="https://js.statickit.com/statickit.js"></script>

<script>
  window.sk=window.sk||function(){(sk.q=sk.q||[]).push(arguments)};

  // Put your StaticKit calls here
  // sk('form', 'init', { ... })
</script>
```

If you have a JavaScript build pipeline in place, it's best to install StaticKit as a dependency:

```shell
npm i @statickit/standalone
```

In your JavaScript file:

```js
import sk from '@statickit/standalone'

// Put your StaticKit calls here
// sk('form', 'init', { ... })
```
